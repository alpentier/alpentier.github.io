<p>I was born and raised in Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>I studied mechanical engineering at the University of Sydney.  After a short stint with Andersen Consulting in Sydney, I moved to the University of Cambridge in 1996.  I worked under David Cebon the Department of Engineering on using active suspension systems to improve the stability and safety of commercial road vehicles.  I graduated with the degree of Ph.D. in 2001.</p>

<p>On completion of my studies, I joined the consulting group at MathWorks, also in Cambridge.  I had worked with the company's products, MATLAB and Simulink, throughout my studies, and was keen to apply myself to projects in the automotive and aerospace industries.  I am heavily involved in using statistical and optimisation methods to reduce development time, increase efficiency and reduce emissions of engines of all shapes and sizes.  I also work on projects involving the modelling and control of mechanical systems, for example, automotive powertrains, aircraft landing gear, and wind turbines.</p>

<p>I took up rowing at Churchill College and was a regular member of the First VIII in the late 1990s.  A highlight was reaching 5th place in the Lent Bumps &mdash; a College men's record.  After graduation, I continued rowing for Cambridge '99 and later Rob Roy.  Now retired from competition, I continue to coach Churchill women's crews.</p>
<p>I enjoy hiking and cycling, and watching many sports including motor racing and biathlon.</p>

<p>I was born and grew up in Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>I studied mechanical engineering at the University of Sydney.  After a short stint with Andersen Consulting in Sydney, I moved to the University of Cambridge in 1996.  I worked under David Cebon the Department of Engineering on using active suspension systems to improve the stability and safety of commercial road vehicles.  I graduated with the degree of Ph.D. in 2001.</p>

<p>On completion of my studies, I joined the consulting group at MathWorks, also in Cambridge.  I had worked with the company's products, MATLAB and Simulink, throughout my studies, and was keen to apply myself to projects in the automotive and aerospace industries.  My current role is Engineering Manager for Northern Europe.</p>

<p>I took up rowing at Churchill College and was a member of the First VIII in the late 1990s.  A highlight was reaching 5th place in the 1998 Lent Bumps &mdash; a College men's record.  After graduation, I competed for Cambridge '99 and later Rob Roy.  Now retired, I continue to coach Churchill women's crews, and have served as President since 2022.</p>
<p>I enjoy hiking and cycling, and watching sports including motor racing and biathlon.</p>

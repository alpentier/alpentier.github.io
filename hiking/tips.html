<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p><img src="sundowner.jpg" alt="Vasque Sundowner GTX" class="thumb"/></p>
<p>For trekking in the Alps and Pyrenees, you will need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>sturdy boots</li>
    <li>trekking poles</li>
    <li>sunscreen</li>
    <li>waterproof clothing</li>
    <li>waterproof pack cover</li>
    <li>sleeping bag liner (for refuges and g&icirc;tes)</li>
    <li>insurance (e.g., through a continental alpine club or the <a href="http://www.thebmc.co.uk/">BMC</a>)</li>
  </ul>
<p>You will not need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>sleeping bag</li>
    <li>tent</li>
    <li>cooking equipment</li>
    <li>ropes and crampons</li>
  </ul>
<p>You might also find useful:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>ice axe if you're going above 3000 metres</li>
    <li>alpine club membership card (for reduced price accommodation in huts of the SAC, CAF, CAI, etc.); you can either join one of the continental clubs directly, or join your local organisation and purchase a <a href="http://www.thebmc.co.uk/Pages.aspx?page=194">reciprocal rights card</a></li>
    </ul>

<h2>Physical preparation</h2>
<p>In principle, you should be in good physical shape <em>before</em> you arrive in the mountains.  In practice, there's only so much you can do if you live at sea level and work behind a desk all day.</p>
<p>Hiking is an endurance sport.  Heart rates range from 100 to 160 depending on the terrain.  You can prepare by running, swimming, cycling or rowing.</p>
<p>Don't try to do too much in the first couple of days; any more than eight hours will be hard work.  You will be amazed how your condition improves, particularly through the first week.</p>

<h2>On the trail</h2>
<p>Start early to take advantage of the morning shade.  It's a great feeling to reach the first col of the day in good time.</p>
<p>Call ahead to reserve accommodation.  You will be more relaxed knowing that there is a meal and a bed waiting for you at the end of the day.  This is essential in peak season.</p>
<p>Eat and drink regularly.  You will be burning a lot of calories and you will bonk if you don't eat.  I recommend PowerBars, dried fruit, and trail mix (sultanas, currants, nuts, and M&Ms).  Chocolate, bread, cheese and yoghurt can be a hassle.  I eat a big dinner and graze during the day.</p>

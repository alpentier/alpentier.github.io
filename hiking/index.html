<p>Hiking in the mountains has a powerful ability to rejuvenate mind and body.  I discovered this on my first visit to the Alps in 1997 and, after a few summers of gaining experience through short hikes, I graduated to multi-week treks in 2001.  Since then, Angie and I have hiked a number of long distance routes in the French Alps, Swiss Alps and French Pyrenees.  In 2008, we completed our first ropes-and-crampons ascent.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of major trips undertaken in the Alps and Pyrenees.  Novice <em>randonneurs</em> may be interested to read a few <a href="tips.html">tips</a>.</p>

<h2>Val d'Arpette</h2>
<p>Now with b&eacute;b&eacute;-&agrave;-bord, five days of walking based in Val d'Arpette in Switzerland, including climbs to Fen&ecirc;tre d'Arpette and Cabane d'Orny.  September 2012.</p>

<h2>Tour du Mont Blanc / GR5</h2>
<p>A multi-GR trek, initially following the Tour du Mont Blanc from Champex to Les Chapieux, then a short section of the Tour de Beaufortain to join the GR5 near Col de Bresson, then south to Brian&ccedil;on.  This time, we took in the full GR5 route through the Vanoise.  September 2011.</p>

<h2>Alpine Pass Route</h2>
<p>A second trip across Switzerland, starting in Sargans and taking in alternative routes and stops.  On reaching Adelboden, we transferred south to Saas Fee, from where we walked around to Zermatt.  September 2010.</p>

<h2>GR58 &quot;Tour du Queyras&quot;</h2>
<p>A trek around the Queyras region of the French Alps.  The stage including Col des Thures is a particular highlight.  There are many opportunities for peakbagging along the entire route.  September 2009.</p>

<h2>GR5 &quot;Grande Travers&eacute;e des Alpes&quot; (south)</h2>
<p>A trek in the southern French Alps, from Modane in Savoie, through Haute-Alpes, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and Alpes-Maritimes, to Menton on the Mediterranean coast.  The GR52 variant through Mercantour National Park is highly recommended.  September 2008.</p>

<h2>Racing</h2>
<h3>Head of the Cam &ndash; Shovellers C 8+ finished 53rd</h3>
<p>I rowed in a Churchill alumni scratch crew at the Head of the Cam in Cambridge on 30 April.  Coming around Grassy Corner, my left shoe broke free of the footplate, so I rowed the majority of the course &quot;foot out&trade;&quot;.  We finished in 10'13&quot;, 2&quot; faster than Simon's single.  <a href="http://www.spannerspotter.com/v/2011/hoc-2011/hoc-2011-div3/313+Churchill+College+BC+M8_+10m13.flv.html">SpannerSpotter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Crew:</strong> Chris Wilson (bow), Dominic Reber, Ben Blamey, Matthew Nicholas, Robert Oeffner, Hank Donaghy, David Sampson, Will Brown (stroke), Lizzy Burden (cox).</p>

<h3><img src="toilet.gif" height="32" width="32" alt="(poor)" class="icon" />Nottingham City Regatta &ndash; Rob Roy IM3 2x finished 4th</h3>
<p>I started sculling in a quad in the spring of 2011.  We were due to race at Nottingham on 21 May, but after an issue with entries, I ended up in a scratch double.  It was a shambles, we sampled three different lanes, and were overtaken by the umpire's launch as it kept up with the rest of the race.</p>
<p><strong>Crew:</strong> Rob Best (bow, steering), David Sampson (stroke).</p>

<h3><img src="pot.gif" height="32" width="32" alt="(pot)" class="icon" />Peterborough Regatta &ndash; Rob Roy IM3 4x finished 1st</h3>
<p>I did race a quad over 1000 metres at Peterborough Regatta on 4 June.  We won IM3, earning a tankard and my first sculling point in what turned out to be my last race.</p>
<p><strong>Crew:</strong> Rob Best (bow, steering), Robbie Kiff, David Sampson, Sam Fabian (stroke).</p>

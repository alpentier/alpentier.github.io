<p>Need reliable boat transport at a sensible price? Let the professionals at Churchill Boat Transport Co. take care of all your boat transport requirements.</p>
<p>Here's a sample of the range of services we have offered to Cambridge College clients over the last six months:</p>
<ul>
<li>We service all major UK regattas. We will deliver your boat direct to your boating location (or at least to a nearby field).</li>
<li>Having trouble spinning? Boat too long? We'll attempt an overly ambitious U-turn and snap the end off for you!</li>
<li>Boats are delivered consistently late, no matter how close the destination. This added stress raises your base heart rate and makes your pre-race warm-up more effective.</li>
<li>We can offer delivery to unusual locations that other boat transporters just can't get to. In particular, we are experts in dealing with low bridges, barbed-wire fences and poorly parked tour buses.</li>
<li>Concerned about your opposition following you to your secret training location? Our trailer indicator wiring is specially reversed to confuse following vehicles.</li>
<li>Tough first round draw at Henley? Arrange for us to transport your opponents to the race... we'll have their boat out of action for months.</li>
<li>All boats are turbo-tied<sup>(TM)</sup> to cope with the enormous acceleration of our dodgy turbocharged 1987 Volvo towing vehicle.</li>
<li>We are the only boat transporters in the UK with a <a href="../work/cambridge.html">vehicle dynamics specialist</a> to configure the trailer for maximum safety.</li>
<li>We now offer a special <em>self-drive service</em>. Prior to delivery, we make a number of modifications to the trailer to ensure that it is unroadworthy. We also give details of your route to the police, to guarantee that you're pulled over. <img src="../resources/icons/new.gif" height="12" width="24" alt="(new)" class="icon" /></li>

<h2>Racing</h2>
<h3>Head of the Cam &ndash; Shovellers C 8+ finished 53rd</h3>
<p>I raced in a Churchill alumni VIII in the Head of the Cam in Cambridge on 1 May.  Three men's crews and one women's crew were entered.  We trundled along in the mid-20s, completing the course in 10'41&quot;.  Disturbingly, that was faster than the previous year.  Equally disturbingly, that was 30&quot; faster than the younger Shovellers B, although Shovellers A was 50&quot; faster.  The women's crew clocked 11'31&quot;, 13&quot; behind W1.</p>
<p>The race was followed by dinner in College, where the naming rights to a new 4+ were auctioned.  I participated but (thankfully?) I did not win that either.</p>
<p><strong>Crew:</strong> Robert Oeffner (bow), Mike Cotton, Andy McElroy, Wimp, David Sampson, Jonathan Thompson, Jonathan Soar, Ian Scott (stroke), Susie Clements (cox).</p>

<h2>Racing</h2>
<h3>University IVs &ndash; First IV lost to Trinity Hall</h3>
<p>Our first race of term was the University IVs, held on the Cam on 30 October. Churchill I's opponent in the first round was Trinity Hall. Trinity Hall, starting behind, made the better start, but the two crews were well matched over the middle section of the course. However, we were never able to get back on terms with Hall, and they ran out winners by 8 seconds.</p>
<h3>Cam Winter Head &ndash; First VIII finished 11th</h3>
<p>The First VIII's first race of term was the 2800 metre Cam Winter Head, held on the Cam on 16 November. After a solid but unspectacular row, we finished 21st overall and 11th in the men's seniors invitational division with a time of 9'41&quot;. This was 42&quot; behind the overall winning crew, CULRC A.</p>

<p>The blue ribband event of Michaelmas term, the Fairbairn Cup, was held over 4300 metres on the Cam on 5 December. We put in a hard-working but unspectacular performance to finish 21st overall and 17th among Cambridge College First VIIIs. Our time of 15'15&quot; was exactly one minute behind the winning crew, 1st &amp; 3rd Trinity.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/boatclub/archive-1998.html">Race results</a></h3>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Race results were, on the whole, disappointing. However, several members of the crew made good technical progress, and with some crew changes for Lent term, we're hoping for improved performances. Thanks to our coaches, especially Mary Young and Don Hefferon.</p>

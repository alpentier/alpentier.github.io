<h2>Racing</h2>
<h3>Head of the Cam &ndash; Shovellers C 8+ finished 53rd</h3>
<p>I raced in a Churchill alumni VIII in the Head of the Cam in Cambridge on 1 May.  Three men's crews and one women's crew were entered.  We trundled along in the mid-20s, completing the course in 10'41&quot;.  Disturbingly, that was faster than the previous year.  Equally disturbingly, that was 30&quot; faster than the younger Shovellers B, although Shovellers A was 50&quot; faster.  The women's crew clocked 11'31&quot;, 13&quot; behind W1.</p>
<p>The race was followed by dinner in College, where the naming rights to a new 4+ were auctioned.  I participated but (thankfully?) I did not win that either.</p>
<p><strong>Crew:</strong> Robert Oeffner (bow), Mike Cotton, Andy McElroy, Wimp, David Sampson, Jonathan Thompson, Jonathan Soar, Ian Scott (stroke), Susie Clements (cox).</p>

</ul>
<p>I raced Cambridge Town Bumps for the final time for Rob Roy II, starting 8th.</p>
<p>On the first night, we were bumped by City II.</p>
<p>On the second night, we rowed over ahead of Champion of the Thames, with City II ahead bumping Sharks.</p>
<p>On the third night, we rowed over behind Sharks and ahead of Champs.
<p>On the fourth night, again we could not catch Sharks, and Champs behind were bumped by Cantabs II, who earned their blades.  City II were denied blades by X-Press.</p>
<p><strong>Crew:</strong> Rob Best (bow), Guy Ellis, Stefan Graf, Rich Mott, David Sampson, Oli Campbell, Brett Saunders, Hugh Anderson (stroke), Maryana Vrubel (cox).</p>

<h3>Ely Small Boats Head &ndash; Rob Roy IM2 2- finished 13th</h3>
<p>I had the privilege of racing a pair with two-time Henley Royal Regatta finalist and cycling companion Simon Goodbrand at Ely Small Boats Head on 7 November.  We completed the 5 km in 21'14&quot;, 13th overall, and fastest pair.  To put this seemingly outstanding achievement in perspective, Simon also raced the single, finishing 1'20&quot; faster.  Angie was fastest women's single in 23'09&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Crew:</strong> Simon Goodbrand (bow, steering), David Sampson (stroke).</p>

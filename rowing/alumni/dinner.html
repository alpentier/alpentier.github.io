<h2><a name="about">An important occasion</a></h2>
<p>2001 marks the 40th anniversary of the Churchill College Boat Club and, to celebrate, the CCBC committee have decided to extend an invitation to all past members of the club to join them for the May Bumps Dinner in the College on Saturday 16 June.</p>
<p>The committee, together with two past members who are currently working in Cambridge -- Eddie Powell (1967-1973) and David Sampson (1996-2000) -- are attempting to contact as many past members as they can.  This involves not only contacting members whom they know directly, but also e-mailing as many past captains as possible and asking them to pass on the details to their contemporaries.</p>

<h2><a name="spread">Spread the word</a></h2>
<p>It is hoped that groups of past members will arrange to come and spend the afternoon down by the Cam watching the racing before coming to College for the dinner.  As the organisers do not have contact details of all past members, they would be most grateful if you could pass the message on.  You may wish to <a href="e-mail.txt">download a sample message</a> with the details of the event and include this in an e-mail message to your friends.</p>

<h2><a name="details">Details of the dinner</a></h2>
<p>There will be a reception at 7:00 PM, followed by dinner at 7:30 PM.  Dress will be black tie; CCBC blazers and ties are optional if you still have either!  The cost of the dinner will be &pound;25 (including VAT) per person, which also includes pre-dinner drinks, wine and port.  You are welcome to bring a partner or spouse along.</p>

<h2><a name="accommodation">Accommodation</a></h2>
<p>The event will be held during full term, but a supply of rooms at Churchill will be available for the night of the dinner.  <em>These rooms will be allocated on a first come, first served basis.</em>  Rooms will be available in the <a href="http://www.mollercentre.co.uk/">M&oslash;ller Centre</a> at the special rates of &pound;43.48 per single and &pound;70.50 per double or twin.  From past experience, the College authorities expect that some further rooms in College staircases may become available closer to the time of the dinner, although availability here is more difficult to predict.  Rooms in College will cost &pound;20.56 per single and &pound;35.25 per double.  <em>All prices include breakfast and VAT.</em>  There is a place to indicate your accommodation preferences on the booking form (see below).  If you request accommodation, Annette Tattersall from the Churchill Alumni Office will contact you to update you on the availability of rooms in College.  You may prefer to make your own arrangements with a hotel or a B&amp;B in Cambridge, and Annette can help to put you in contact with suitable establishments.</p>
